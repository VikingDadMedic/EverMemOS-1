"""
Omega Layer - Cognitive processing and memory substrate for Omega.

This layer sits on top of EverMemOS, adding:
- Pentagram vertex system (5 cognitive faculties)
- Metabolic kernel (central synthesizer)
- Identity topology (omega_scar.json validation/evolution)
- Development monitoring (growth tracking)
- Corpus integration (cross-reference mining)
- Omega-specific memory extractors
- Domain-agnostic experience processing prompts

When OMEGA_MODE is enabled, interactions route through the Pentagram
before being stored via the existing MemoryManager (Ledger vertex).
When disabled, EverMemOS functions normally.
